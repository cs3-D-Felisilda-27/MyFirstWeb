				<h1>Daisy</h1>
				<h1>By wave to earth</h1>
				<h3>Daisy, you're always white in your place</h3>
				<h3>Even between the concrete</h3>
				<h3>Daisy, every time I see you, my day is getting coloured</h3>
				<h3>Babe, if you can dye me enough, would my life be different?</h3>
				<h3>So, I'll just wait for you to bloom</h3>
				<h3>My planet is like an old black and white TV</h3>
				<h3>Life always goes on and on</h3>
				<h3>But, it's never fun at all</h3>
				<h3>Oh daisy, it's my happiness to run into you</h3>
				<h3>Life always goes on and on</h3>
				<h3>But, I'll live with you forever</h3>
				<h3>So, be my daisy</h3>
